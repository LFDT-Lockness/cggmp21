# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking interest to contributing to our project!

## Join us in Discord!
We welcome all contributors to communicate with us [in Discord]! Please, reach out to us
in `#lockness-contribute` room.

## Pull Requests
Prior to making a PR, we ask you to communicate it with us, either [in Discord] or, if you
prefer, by opening an issue in the repo. This would help to keep your work aligned with the
maintainers view and avoid situations in which we can't accept your contribution.

All commits are required to be signed via verified GPG key. You can read about commit signing
in [this series of articles](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification)
(we recommend using a hardware GPG token).

All commits are required to be signed off by including `Signed-off-by: YOUR NAME <your_email@example.com>` line.
By doing this, you certify that the commit is compliant with [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/),
meaning that you wrote the code or otherwise have the right to submit the code you are
contributing to the project.
